CLGE Program structure:

- World
	-> Objects
	-> Children => World & Objects
- Screen 
	-> Objects
	-> Settings
		=> Width & Height
		=> Border
		=> Standard symbol for rendering
		=> Rendering settings (Much)
	-> Periodic functions:
		* Start (Runs once, when the program starts)
		* Update (Runs every cycle of the program)
		* FixedUpdate (Runs with a fixed timeout)
		* PreUpdate (Runs before Update, has the goal to prepare things for Update)
		* LateUpdate (Runs after rendering the frame, has the same goal as FixedUpdate)
		* Destroy (Runs when the program is terminated by the destroy function in Screen)

- Object (Behaviour)
	-> Components (change behaviour)
	-> Children => Object
	=> Standard components:
		* Transform 2D/3D

- Component
	-> Always has a name
	-> May have some of the periodic functions
	-> Defines a bit of the behaviour of the object
	-> May be created by the user

- Classes from outside the components
	* KeyDetector => Detects key presses when needed
	* MouseDetector => Same principle as the KeyDetector
	* Utils => Has some utilitary functions as clamp etc.
	* Exceptions => Class for creating custom exceptions.

- Screen types:
	* STDScreen: Is imported by import clge.Screen. Uses fast but optimized for 2d rendering method
	* ALTScreen: Is imported by import clge.AltScreen. Uses slow rendering for 2d but is faster for 3d
