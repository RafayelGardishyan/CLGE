Philosphy of "Command Line Game Engine"

Command Line Game Engine is a Game engine made in Python(3) and renders everything in CMD for Windows and Terminal for Linux and Mac OS
From now we'll define "Command Line Game Engine" as CLGE

CLGE is made to make CMD and Terminal popular again because with the new technologies and GUI's the popularity of Command Line interfaces is gone.

CLGE is also made so that every programming beginner and proffesional can make their own games using only a couple of predefined statements.

CLGE uses the object system as in Unity. This means that every oject derives from the class "Behaviour". An object can ba a Screen object (2D or 3D), Camera, Sound Player etc. Also every object has to be added to a World object. Every object which has a renderer object in it (2D or 3D) immediately is displayed on the screen.

More about CLGE you can read on the Documantation/Wiki
